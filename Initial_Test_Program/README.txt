There are two files located in this folder called 'Initial_Test_Program'. 

The first file is called 'Initial_Test_Program.cpp'. This file uses four 
functions; addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. All four functions
pass two integer variables. 

The second file is the same program but it was converted to ARM assembly code.
The website used to convert is https://godbolt.org
The converter on the website is: ARM gcc 4.5.4

The third website that I found was used to convert the ARM assembly language
to HEX values. http://armconverter.com/ Using this converter, I saved all the
values in file called: Initial_Test_Program.HEX
In this website, the converter is 'x32 - ARM32/AArch32/ARMv7'
